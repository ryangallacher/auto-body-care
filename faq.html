            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
            <h2>Do you do work for both Trade & Public?</h2>
            <p>The car trade are our main customers, but we always try our best to serve the general public as well.</p>
            <h2>Can the dents come back?</h2>
            <p>No, all repairs are permanent. The only way a dent will appear on your car is if a new dent occurs.</p>
            <h2>How do I know you're any good?</h2>
            <p>Have a look at the <a href="gallery.html">Gallery<a> section. These are all dents which have been repaired by Auto Body Care.
                We don't show pictures of other peoples work! 
                We were trained in these techniques in the USA in 1996 and have been fixing dents ever since.
